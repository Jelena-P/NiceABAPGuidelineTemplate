# NiceABAPGuidelineTemplate

Are you tired of 100+ pages of ABAP guideline documents repeating same old adage? Say no more, fam! I present to you...

**Jelena's Nice and Simple Corporate ABAP Guideline Template**

1.	Introduction (1-2 pages). Outline your companyâ€™s strategy, principles, what your guidelines are meant to achieve and how they add value.  
2.	Naming conventions. Note any peculiarities (for example, some companies use special IDs in the package or object names). If this section takes more than 2 pages then you are doing it wrong. 
3.	References (links) to Community guidelines and a reminder to RTFM (1 page)
4.	Developer tools. Do not copy from SAP Help, only note anything specific to how your organization uses them and if any third-party tools are also in place.  1-2 pages
5.	Any requirements specific to your organization. This can include regulatory compliance, accessibility requirements, and such. Up to 3 pages. 

Total number of pages while using this template shall not exceed 10.
